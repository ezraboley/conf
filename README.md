.*rc files for maximizing productivity

Use the installer script to interactively add these to your home directory
It will create a directory of your old scripts that you can save as backups or 
delete at your leisure.

Just run `./install.sh` and it will interactively walk you through getting the
scripts set up.

Enjoy!
